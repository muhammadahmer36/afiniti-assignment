oot@asterisk13-build /]# yum groupinstall –y Development Tools
You will also need to install the following packages:

[root@asterisk13-build /]#
yum install –y ncurses-dev uuid-devel libuuid-devel libxml2-devel sqlite-devel bison subversion git-core



[root@asterisk13-build /]# cd /usr/src/
[root@asterisk13-build /]# wget http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/asterisk-13-current.tar.gz
[root@asterisk13-build /]# tar –xzvf asterisk-13-current.tar.gz
[root@asterisk13-build /]# cd asterisk-13.0.0
[root@asterisk13-build /]# ./bootstrap.sh
[root@asterisk13-build /]# ./configure
[root@asterisk13-build /]# make && make install
[root@asterisk13-build /]# make samples
[root@asterisk13-build /]# sudo make config
[root@asterisk13-build /]# make samples
[root@asterisk13-build /]# chkconfig asterisk on



From here, you can type asterisk –r and the asterisk CLI should appear. It should look like this :

These build steps works for CentOS 5.x-7.x
Installing Development Tools is optional, but it makes the build a lot easier. This will be seen if you don’t install the package group.
